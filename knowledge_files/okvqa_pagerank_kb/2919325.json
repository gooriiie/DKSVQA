It is a noble gas. Neon is a colorless, odorless, inert monatomic gas under standard conditions, with about two-thirds the density of air. It was discovered in 1898 as one of the three residual rare inert elements remaining in dry air, after nitrogen, oxygen, argon and carbon dioxide were removed. Neon was the second of these three rare gases to be discovered, and was immediately recognized as a new element from its bright red emission spectrum. The name neon is derived from the Greek word, \u03bd\u03ad\u03bf\u03bd, neuter", "The door is made of wood.", "The light is illuminating the drawing.", "The door is a moving structure used to block off an entrance, typically consisting of a panel that swings on hinges or that slides or rotates inside of a space.", "The lighting is fluorescent.", "This is a nightclub door.", "Graffiti is writing or drawings made on a wall or other surface, usually without permission and within public view.", "Phosphorescent paint is a paint that exhibits phosphorescence."]

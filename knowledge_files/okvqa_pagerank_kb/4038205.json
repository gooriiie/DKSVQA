Planes are used to flatten, reduce the thickness of, and impart a smooth surface to a rough piece of lumber or timber. Planing is also used to produce horizontal, vertical, or inclined flat surfaces on workpieces usually too large for shaping, where the integrity of the whole requires the same smooth surface. Special types of planes are designed to cut joints or decorative mouldings.", "The plane is taking off", "A plane is a tool for making surfaces smooth.", "A plane is a three-dimensional object that has length, width, and height.", "A plane is an object that has a flat surface with no thickness.", "A plane is a flat surface that extends infinitely far.

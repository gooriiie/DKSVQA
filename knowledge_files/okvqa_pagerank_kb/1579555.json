The rails and perpendicular beams are collectively known as the track.", "A track is a permanent way on which trains are run. Tracks usually consist of two parallel steel rails, fixed to sleepers (UK) or ties (US) which are embedded in ballast and laid in a bed.", "A toy train is a toy that represents a train. It is distinguished from a model train by an emphasis on low cost and durability, rather than scale modeling. A toy train can be as simple as a pull toy that does not even run on track, or it might be operated by clockwork or a battery. Most scales are smaller than the commonly used model railroading scales. The most popular scales are O scale and HO scale.", "The model railroads you can build using Factory Direct Trains-bought products and accessories are unlimited.

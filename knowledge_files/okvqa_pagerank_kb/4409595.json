["A complementary color is a color that is opposite of another color on a color wheel.", "Colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel are considered to be complementary colors (example: red and green). The high contrast of complementary colors creates a vibrant look especially when used at full saturation.", "The primary colors of light are red, green and blue.", "The complementary color of dark blue is yellow.", "The complementary color of blue is yellow.", "The complementary color of blue is orange.", "Red and green are complementary colors.", "The complementary color of yellow is purple.", "The complementary colour of yellow is purple.", "The complementary color of orange is blue.", "The color of light complementary to the color of the light in the top right corner is red.", "Complimentary colors are colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel.", "The complementary color of the light in the top right corner is red.", "Complimentary colors are pairs of colors that are on opposite sides of the color wheel, such as red and green, yellow and purple, or blue and orange.", "the complementary color of the light in the top right corner is blue.", "The complementary color of the light in the top right corner is magenta.", "The complementary color of red is cyan.", "The complementary color of the light in the top right corner is purple.", "Yellow is the color between orange and green on the spectrum of visible light. It is evoked by light with a dominant wavelength of roughly 570\u2013590 nm.", "Red is the complementary color of cyan.", "Complementary colors are pairs of colors which, when combined or mixed, cancel each other out (lose hue) by producing a grayscale color like white or black. When placed next to each other, they create the strongest contrast for those particular two colors.", "The color wheel is a visual representation of colors arranged according to their chromatic relationship.", "The color wheel or color circle is an abstract illustrative organization of color hues around a circle, which shows the relationships between primary colors, secondary colors, tertiary colors etc.", "The color wheel is a tool that designers use to identify colors that look good together.", "The color of light is white.", "Complimentary colors are pairs of colors which, when combined or mixed, cancel each other out (lose hue) by producing a grayscale color like white or black.", "The color wheel is the basis of color theory, because it shows the relationship between colors.", "The color wheel can be divided into primary, secondary and tertiary colors. Primary colors are the most basic colors. They are colors that can't be created by mixing any other colors. Secondary colors are created by mixing primary colors. Tertiary colors are created by mixing primary and secondary colors.", "The color of a light source is determined by its temperature.", "In color theory, a color scheme is the choice of colors used in design for a range of media. For example, the \"Achromatic\" use of a white background with black text is an example of a basic and commonly default color scheme in web design.", "Red is the color of blood, strawberries, and roses.", "The color of the light falling on an object depends on the object's surface. If the surface is a bright color, the light will be bright. If the surface is a dark color, the light will be dark."]

Snowshoeing is a form of hiking. Traditional snowshoes have a hardwood frame with rawhide lacings. Some modern snowshoes are similar, but most are made of materials such as lightweight metal, plastic, and synthetic fabric. In addition to distributing the weight, snowshoes are generally raised at the toe for maneuverability. They must not accumulate snow, hence the latticework", "There is no limit to how fast you can go when using this equipment.", "Snowshoeing is a winter sport that is popular in many countries around the world.", "One can go at the speed of 20 miles per hour.", "Snowshoeing is a form of hiking.", "The maximum speed of the fastest human on earth is about 27 miles per hour.", "The skis are about 1.2 m (4 ft) long and weigh about 3 kg (7 lb)."]

Ships are generally distinguished from boats based on their larger size, shape, and cargo or passenger capacity. Small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes, or in protected coastal areas. However, some boats, such as the whaleboat, were intended for use in an offshore environment. In modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard another vessel. Another less restrictive definition is a vessel that can be lifted out of the water.", "The deep ocean is the largest habitat on earth, and it is also the least explored."]

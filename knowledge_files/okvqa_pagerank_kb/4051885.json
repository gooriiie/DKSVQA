["A computer is an electronic device that can receive a set of instructions, or program, and then carry out this program by performing calculations on numerical data or by compiling and correlating other forms of information.", "A computer is a programmable machine that receives input, stores and manipulates data, and provides output in a useful format.", "A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks.", "A computer is a programmable device that can automatically perform a sequence of calculations or other operations on data once programmed for the task.", "A computer monitor is an output device which displays information in pictorial form.", "A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming.", "A computer monitor is an electronic device that shows pictures for computers.", "A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming.

Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.", "A desktop computer is a personal computer designed for regular use at a single location on or near a desk or table due to its size and power requirements.", "The keyboard is the piece of computer hardware used to input text, characters, and other commands into a computer or similar device.", "This device is a desktop computer.", "A computer monitor is an output device that displays information in pictorial form. A monitor usually comprises the display device, circuitry, casing, and power supply.", "A desktop computer is a personal computer that is designed to fit comfortably on top of a desk, rather than being stowed away in a tower case.", "The device is a computer monitor.", "A computer monitor is an output device which displays information in pictorial form. A monitor usually comprises the display device, circuitry, casing, and power supply. The display device in modern monitors is typically a thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) with LED backlighting having replaced cold-cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlighting.", "A keyboard is a typewriter-style device which uses an arrangement of buttons or keys to act as mechanical levers or electronic switches.", "A keyboard is a typewriter-style device, which uses an arrangement of buttons or keys, to act as mechanical levers or electronic switches.", "A keyboard is an input device, partially modeled after the typewriter keyboard, which uses an arrangement of buttons or keys to act as mechanical levers or electronic switches.", "The keyboard is a computer keyboard.", "They are called monitors."]

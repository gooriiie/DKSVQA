The air moving over the top moves faster than the air moving under the kite.", "Kite flying is a popular sport.", "Kites are often flown at the beach.", "A kite is traditionally characterized by a bridle and tail, a set of wings, and a line. A kite consists of wings, tether, anchors, and anchors.", "A kite is a tethered heavier-than-air craft with wing surfaces that react against the air to create lift and drag. A kite consists of wings, tethers and anchors. Kites often have a bridle and tail to guide the face of the kite at the correct angle so the wind can lift it. Some kite designs don\u2019t need a bridle; box kites can have a single attachment point. A kite may have fixed or moving anchors that can balance the kite. One technical definition is that a kite is \u201ca collection of tether-coupled wing sets", "Kites have been flown in China since ancient times.", "Kites can be flown in a park.", "Kites have been flown since remote antiquity, both for recreation and scientific investigation.", "Kites were invented in China, where materials ideal for kite building were readily available: silk fabric for sail material; fine, high-tensile-strength silk for flying line; and resilient bamboo for a strong, lightweight framework.", "The kite is flown in the sky by the wind, but it is not blown by the wind.", "They are flying in the sky."]

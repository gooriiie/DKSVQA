Other factors that can limit forward navigation include the rider's skill level and physical condition, the bicycle's performance capabilities, and the presence of other cyclists or pedestrians.", "The limits of forward navigation in this scenario are the streets and sidewalks, as the cyclists are pushing a truck and the man on the bicycle is riding with a man on a bike."]

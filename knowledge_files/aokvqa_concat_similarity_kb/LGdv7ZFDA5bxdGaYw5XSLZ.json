["The zebra's stripes are for camouflage and protection. The stripes help the zebra blend into its environment, making it more difficult for predators to spot them. The stripes also act as a form of protection from biting insects.", "The zebra's stripes are thought to provide camouflage from predators by breaking up the zebra's outline and making it harder to spot in tall grasses or in the shadows of trees. The stripes may also help the herd stay together by providing a visual cue to the other zebras."]

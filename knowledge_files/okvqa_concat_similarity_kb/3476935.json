["The time of day can be determined by the angle of the sun relative to the horizon. If the sun is low in the sky, it is likely early morning or late afternoon. If the sun is high in the sky, it is likely midday.", "It is daytime, as indicated by the sunny window and the clothes drying on the washing line."]

["To make a cake like the one in the photo, you will need to bake a round cake in a springform pan. Once the cake is cooled, frost it with a layer of buttercream frosting. Then, use a knife to carve out a large slice of the cake. Place the slice of cake on a plate and decorate it with sprinkles and other decorations of your choice.", "To make this kind of cake, you will need cake mix, butter, sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, and food coloring. You will also need a 9-inch round cake pan, parchment paper, and a rolling pin. Combine the cake mix, butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract in a bowl and mix until combined. Grease the cake pan with butter and line it with parchment paper. Pour the cake batter into the pan and bake for 25 minutes. Once the cake is cooled, roll out the fondant and cover the cake with it. Finally, decorate the cake with your desired decorations."]

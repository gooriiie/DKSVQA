["The location of the aeroplane can be determined by looking at the type of aircraft, the runway markings, and the surroundings. If the aircraft is a commercial airliner, it could be at any major airport. If the aircraft is a military plane, it could be at a military base.", "The airplane is likely seen at an airport, as the tail of the airplane is parked on the runway and there is a hangar nearby."]

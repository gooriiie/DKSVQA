["Waves are caused by the wind blowing over the surface of the ocean. The energy of the wind is transferred to the water, creating an area of high pressure in front of the wind and an area of low pressure behind it. This causes the water to rise up and form a wave.", "Waves are created by the wind blowing across the surface of the ocean, creating a swell that travels across the ocean and eventually breaks on the shore."]

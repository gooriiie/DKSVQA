["The color of the fire hydrant is legal. Fire hydrants are typically painted yellow in the United States to make them easily visible in case of an emergency.", "Fire hydrants are typically painted yellow, but they can also be painted other colors, depending on local regulations. In some areas, fire hydrants may be painted red or blue to indicate that the hydrant is connected to a private fire suppression system."]

["Benjamin Franklin had used one of these floating objects in a famous experiment on electricity.", "A kite is traditionally a tethered heavier-than-air craft with wing surfaces that react against the air to create lift and drag. A kite consists of wings, tethers and anchors. Kites often have a bridle and tail to guide the face of the kite at the correct angle so the wind can lift it."]

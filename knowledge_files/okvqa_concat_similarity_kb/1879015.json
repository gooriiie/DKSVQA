["The tops of these towers are domes, not minarets. Minarets are tall, slender towers that are usually attached to a mosque. Domes are typically round or polygonal and are used to cover a large space.", "The top of the tower is a steeple, a tall, pointed structure that is usually topped with a small spire and often contains a clock or bell."]

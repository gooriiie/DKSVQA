Place the cookie shapes on a baking sheet and bake according to the instructions on the cookie dough package. Once the cookies are cooled, layer them with your favorite sandwich filling and top with another cookie. Enjoy!", "To make the cookie cookie sandwich, you will need two cookies, a layer of frosting or icing, and a layer of your favorite filling.

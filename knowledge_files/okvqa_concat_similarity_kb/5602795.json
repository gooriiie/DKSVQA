["Light refraction occurs when light passes through a medium, such as air, water, glass, or other transparent material, and is bent when it encounters a different medium. This bending of the light is due to the change in the speed of light as it passes from one medium to another. The different colors of the rainbow are caused by the different wavelengths of light being bent at different angles as they pass through the medium.", "Light refraction occurs when light passes through a medium, such as water or glass, and the speed of the light changes. This causes the light to bend and create a rainbow effect. The different colors of the rainbow are caused by the different wavelengths of light being bent at different angles."]

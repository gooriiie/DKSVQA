["A Buddhist temple typically does not have a steeple, and usually features a stupa or pagoda instead. Additionally, Buddhist temples are often adorned with statues of the Buddha, while Christian churches feature statues of Jesus and other religious figures.", "The architecture of a church typically includes a steeple, which is a tall tower with a cross on top, and stained glass windows, which are not typically found in Buddhist temples."]

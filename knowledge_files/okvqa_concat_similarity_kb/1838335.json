["At a four-way stop, the driver who reaches the intersection first has the right of way. If two vehicles arrive at the same time, the driver on the right has the right of way. If there are more than two vehicles, the driver to the right of the first vehicle should proceed first.", "At an intersection with a stop sign, drivers must come to a complete stop and yield the right of way to any vehicle that has already entered the intersection."]

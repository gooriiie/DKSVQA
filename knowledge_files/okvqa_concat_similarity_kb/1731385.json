["The movements of the body of water featured in this photo are controlled by the gravitational pull of the moon.", "The movements of the ocean are controlled by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun. The moon's gravity causes the ocean tides to rise and fall twice a day. The sun's gravity also affects the ocean, causing the water to bulge out in the direction of the sun."]

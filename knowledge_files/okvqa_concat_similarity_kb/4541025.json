["The kite in the air flies because of the principle of lift, which is the force generated by the air passing over and under the kite's wings.", "The kite is flying due to the principle of lift, which is generated by the air moving over the curved surface of the kite. The air pressure above the kite is lower than the air pressure below the kite, causing the kite to be pushed upwards."]

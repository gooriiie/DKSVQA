["It is difficult to tell from the picture if the car is parked legally or illegally. However, a parking meter is usually an indication that the car is parked legally.", "The legality of the car's parking depends on the local parking regulations. The car must be parked in a designated parking spot and must have the appropriate amount of coins in the parking meter."]

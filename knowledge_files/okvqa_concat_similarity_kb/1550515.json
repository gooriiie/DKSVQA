["The gravitational pull of the Moon causes the ocean tides on Earth.", "The gravitational pull of the Moon causes two bulges in the Earth's oceans - one on the side closest to the Moon, and one on the side furthest from the Moon. This phenomenon is known as the 'tidal effect' and it causes the ocean to rise and fall twice per day."]

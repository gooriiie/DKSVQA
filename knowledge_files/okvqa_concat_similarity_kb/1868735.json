["A boat is a watercraft of a large range of sizes designed to float, plane, work or travel on water. Small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes, or in protected coastal areas. However, boats such as the whaleboat were designed for operation from a ship in an offshore environment.", "A rowboat is a small boat that is rowed by one or more people."]

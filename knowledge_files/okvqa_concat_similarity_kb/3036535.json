["Horses are herbivores, so they need a diet that is high in fiber and low in protein. They should be fed a diet of hay, grass, oats, and other grains, as well as fresh vegetables and fruits.", "Horses require a balanced diet of hay, grain, and forage. They may also need supplements such as vitamins and minerals, depending on the individual horse's needs."]
